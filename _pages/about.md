Hello! 

I'm (yet another) aspiring machine learning researcher. My interest lies in learning representations of data that provably improve the robustness and effectiveness of machine learning when the amount of available resources is scarce. I'm particularly interested in using statistical and information theoretic tools to do so.

I'm currently a research intern at the Vector Institute working with the (amazing) [Chris Maddison](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/). Previously, I was lucky enough to be a [Facebook AI Resident](https://research.fb.com/programs/facebook-ai-residency-program/). Before moving to research, I worked on more applied AI projects at different startups. For example, developing algorithms at [Grab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grab_(company)) to analyse text in under-research languages (Thai, Khmer, Burmese, ...); or predicting room occupancy at [SBS](https://sensiblebuildingscience.com/) to decrease the carbon footprint of large buildings in Vancouver.

Outside of machine learning I spend my time playing sports with friends (:ski:,:mountain:,:badminton:,:basketball:,:volleyball:,:runner:), travelling, or reading about geopolitics.
